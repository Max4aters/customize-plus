## Reset control's values

Each custom control's default setting can be resetted in three ways:

- `Reset to last saved value` which restore the setting value to the last saved one. So pressing the Save button while  you're customizing your website will change the effect of this reset action.
- `Reset to initial session value` which brings the setting to the value it had when the Customize page has loaded. The difference with the above reset action is that this does not care about the different values that have been stored when pressing the Save button, it will always reset to the value as it was when the page has just loaded, which should also be the last value stored in the database before opening the Customize screen.
- `Reset to factory value`. This brings the setting value to its default value as defined by your current theme developers.
