 * Overflow fix.
 *
 * This allow to use custom dropdowns or typeahead elements
 * without having to attach them to the body (which is not a
 * very common feature in those js libraries...).
 *
 * WordPress uses `overflow: hidden` on sections
 * but this prevent us to use popovers, dropdowns or typeahead
 * elements dynamically appended to the controls without having
 * to attach them to the body (which is not a very common
 * feature in those js libraries...). The following fix uses
 * `box-sizing` and float left 100% technique to fix it.
